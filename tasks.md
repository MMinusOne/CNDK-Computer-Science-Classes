# Task-List 

# Phase 1

1 - Make a program to print "Hello".
2 - Extract the string "Hello" in a variable.
3 - Use the `+=` operator on the variable to add your name.
4 - Make a dict variable `person` containing key `name`.
5 - Add the key `class` and `age` to the dict.
6 - Make two prints to print the person's class first, then their age.

# Phase 2 

7 - Make variable `people` being a list of names.
8 - Make a variable `peopleData` that contains keys for all elements of `people`, their values being another dict of `class` and `age`
9 - print everyone's data from the people list using the people list to index the dict.
10 - Assign a new person named after you that has it's own data.
11 - Left-bitshift assign the person's age by two and print it.
12 - Re-assign `class` to be a different class.
13 - Assign a new name entry to the dict with it's own data. 

# Phase 3 

14 - Make a variable `number` and assign it to 5 left-bitshift 2 and print it.
15 - Use the `-=` operator to decrement it by `number * 4` and print it.
16 - Use the right-bitshift assignment operator to shift it by 2 and print it.
17 - Make a new variable `number_2` and assign it to `number + 6` and print it.
18 - Calculate the difference between `number` and `number_2` and print it.
19 - Divide `number` by `number` in a variable `number_3` and print it's type.
20 - Assign the values of all the numbers thus far to `0` and print them.

# Phase 4 

21 - Make a variable `float_1` and assign it to `10.0`
22 - Use the `*=` operator to multiply it by `5`.
23 - Print the type of `float_1`.

# Phase 5 

24 - Make a bool `is_old` and print  it's negation.
25 - Make two variables `name_1` and `name_2`, and print it's equality and in-equality.
26 - Make variables `age_1` and `age_2` and conclude a boolean that indiciates if `age_1` is bigger than `age_2`, then print it.
27 - Print the boolean if `age_1` is less than `age_2`.
28 - Use addition on `name_1` and `name_2` to make `name_3` and print it.
